# ABL - A Better Loader

ABL (pronounced \ˈā-bəl\) is A Better Loader for EcmaScript/JavaScript. It loads JavaScript in the most efficient, non-blocking way possible, and allows for dependency management (A.js depends on B.js, B.js depends on D.js, D.js depends on C.js) and allows for code that executes document.write to inject scripts.
